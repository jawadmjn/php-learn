# Readme

This is merely a collection of PHP Codesamples I wanted to keep, for learning purposes.


#List

## PHP best practises

* reflections
* traits
* interfaces
* dependency injections
* SOLID



## SOLID

S   Single Responsibility Principle
    A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that the class should have only
    one job.

O   Open-Closed Principle
    Objects or Entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification

L   Liskov Substitution Principle
    Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of Type T. Then q(y) should be provable for
    objects y of type S where S is substitute of T.

I   Interface Segregation Principle
    A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients
    shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

D   Dependency Inversion Principle
    Entitites must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that high level module must
    not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
    => principle alows for decoupling
